`bin/generate-bundle.js list` -> List available modules (used for the --modules argument)

`bin/generate-bundle.js bundle ebay` -> Create a bundle under the ebay folder

`bin/generate-bundle.js bundle ebay --modules button carousel` -> Create a bundle under the ebay folder with only button and carousel modules

`bin/generate-bundle.js bundle ebay --scope-class ebay --scope-specificity 5` -> Create a bundle under the ebay folder with all CSS styles wrapped under `.ebay.ebay.ebay.ebay.ebay {}`
