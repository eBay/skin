## Install

## Versioning

As of v3, Skin follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).

Prior to v3, Skin does **not** follow strict semantic versioning, and uses the following convention instead:

1. **PATCH** version when we make backwards-compatible bug fixes AND when we add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.
1. **MINOR** version when we make incompatible API changes.
1. **MAJOR** version when we make radical architectural changes (i.e this will be the next version of Skin, Skin3).

## Releases &amp; Milestones

From v3 onwards, please refer to our publicly visible [releases](https://github.com/eBay/skin/releases) and [milestones](https://github.com/eBay/skin/milestones) pages.

Prior to v3, all releases and milestones can only be viewed on the old, internal repository.

## Browser Support

Please view our [@ebay/browserslist-config](https://github.com/eBay/browserslist-config/blob/master/index.js) to see which browsers we currently support.

SPOILER: we do not support IE10 or under.

## Issues

Please use our publicly visible [issues page](https://github.com/eBay/skin/issues) to ask questions, report issues or submit feature requests.

**If you are not sure whether your issue should be publicly visible, please use our internal GitHub.**

To help track your issue, the Skin admins will assign it with a coloured label from one or more of the following categories:

* Black: Issue Type (e.g. bug, question, test case)
* White: Resolution (e.g. wont fix, invalid, duplicate)
* Gray: Status (e.g. backlog, in progress, help wanted)
* Red: Blocker (e.g. dependency, discussion, design)
* Green: Module (e.g. button, radio, dialog)
* Blue: Aspect (e.g. build, documentation, website)
* Pink: Design System (e.g. DS4 or DS6)
* Yellow: Semver Guidance (e.g. breaking change, backwards compatible)
