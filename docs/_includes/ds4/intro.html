                <h3>Accessible</h3>
                <p>Skin leverages semantic HTML, SVG, ARIA roles, states and properties to apply our styles wherever possible, thus enforcing correct, accessible markup.</p>

                <h3>Declarative</h3>
                <p>Skin follows the <a href="http://getbem.com">BEM</a> methadology of "Block, Element and Modifier" to ensure our HTML class name and structure is human readable and understandable.</p>

                <h3>Decoupled</h3>
                <p>Skin is decoupled from the JavaScript layer, meaning that HTML and CSS should not need to be reimplemented when the JS frontend framework changes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid__cell grid__cell--one-half">
                <h3>Evergreen</h3>
                <p>As the eBay design system evolves, so too does Skin, meaning apps only need to keep their Skin package updated to ensure the latest look and feel.</p>
