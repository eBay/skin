        <p>Because the Dialog component markup was built in a forward-looking way (e.g. for DS6), 
            we have opted to remove the <span class="highlight">&lt;header/&gt;</span>. This change
            necessitates some changes for the DS4 version of the dialog, specifically in the
            following ways:</p>
        
        <ul class="note-list">
            <li><strong>The first H2 heading will become the de facto dialog title for the dialog</strong>,
                and therefore, we suggest you place it at the beginning of the 
                <span class="highlight">dialog__body</span>. This will ensure it is semantically
                correct, and won't interfere with layout of the body content.</li>
            <li><strong>The close button is currently required for accessibility</strong>, whether or 
                not your design calls for it. This is to ensure that your dialog can be closed, and is a
                landmark for limited sight users. <em>However,</em> if you have a need to hide the close button
                we have provided a class <span class="highlight">dialog--hide-close-button</span> which will
                hide the button from view and from screen readers. <strong>Use the 
                <span class="highlight">dialog--hide-close-button</span> class with caution</strong>
                as we cannot guarantee your site will pass accessibilty tests.</li>
            <li><strong>Using a "back" button is not encouraged</strong>, but is supported to ensure
                backward compatibility with existing features (e.g. sub page, multistep).</li>
            <li><strong>The search dialog has been removed as an example</strong>, as design and engineering feel it's 
                featues and markup should be placed within the <span class="highlight">dialog__body</span>.</li>
        </ul>
    </span>
