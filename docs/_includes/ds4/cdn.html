    <h2>CDN</h2>
    <p>A CSS file containing the full collection of modules (except grid) for small screens is available via the following url:</p>
    <p><a href="http://ir.ebaystatic.com/cr/v/c1/skin/v5.1.0/ds4/skin.min.css">https://ir.ebaystatic.com/cr/v/c1/skin/v5.1.0/ds4/skin.min.css</a></p>
    <p>A small CSS file containing only the additional rules for large screens, for an adaptive approach, is also available:</p>
    <p><a href="http://ir.ebaystatic.com/cr/v/c1/skin/v5.1.0/ds4/skin-large.min.css">https://ir.ebaystatic.com/cr/v/c1/skin/v5.1.0/ds4/skin-large.min.css</a></p>
    <p>Finally, a CSS file containing all rules (with the large rules contained in a media query) is available at:</p>
    <p><a href="http://ir.ebaystatic.com/cr/v/c1/skin/v5.1.0/ds4/skin-full.min.css">https://ir.ebaystatic.com/cr/v/c1/skin/v5.1.0/ds4/skin-full.min.css</a></p>
    <p>Using this "full" file effectively means that your site is opting into a responsive approach rather than adaptive.</p>
