<div id="switch">
    <h2>Switch</h2>
    <p>A switch behaves like a checkbox - it can be on or off (i.e checked or unchecked) - and under the hood, that's exactly what it is. Whereas checkboxes are often used to allow multi-selection from a group of choices, switches are more often used in isolation or as a series of unrelated options.</p>
    <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The example below shows the switch in isolation, without any label. Please see the <a href="#field">field</a> module for details on labelling controls. Remember: every switch requires a label!</p>

    <div class="demo">
        <div class="demo__inner">
            <span class="switch">
                <input aria-label="Switch Demo" type="checkbox" />
                <span></span>
            </span>
        </div>
    </div>
    {% highlight html %}
<span class="switch">
    <input type="checkbox" />
    <span></span>
</span>
    {% endhighlight %}

</div>
