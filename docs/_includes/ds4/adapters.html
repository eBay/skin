    <h2>Adapters</h2>
    <p>Skin takes advantage of <a href="https://github.com/lasso-js/lasso#conditional-dependencies">conditional dependencies</a> in Lasso.js, to provide <em>adaptive</em> CSS for every component.</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Skin itself <strong>does not</strong> do any detection of browser size or capabilities, therefore it is the responsibility of the application logic (typically via device detection service) to detect which adapters are needed.</p>

    <h3>Skin Large</h3>
    <p>Skin is built for small screens first (7" and below). Styles for larger screens (i.e. desktop) are <strong>not</strong> supplied by default.</p>
    <p>To meet the conditional dependency for large screen styles, Lasso.js requires the <span class="highlight">skin-large</span> flag.</p>

    <h3>Skin DS</h3>
    <p>Skin has the capability to switch between previous, current and upcoming design systems at a component level.</p>
    <p>To opt into the upcoming design system (<a href="ds6">DS6</a>), Lasso.js requires the <span class="highlight">skin-ds6</span> flag. Please note that not all modules are available in DS6 yet.</p>
    <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> There are some differences between design system versions, in terms of HTML structure and class names, so be sure to reference the appropriate documentation. In general we try to minimise these differences, but in some cases it cannot be avoided.</p>
