    <p>The page grid module establishes the rows, columns and areas onto which child elements can be placed. The page grid is fully responsive.</p>
    <p>Setting up a responsive page grid requires two key elements: a container element, and the grid element itself.</p>
    <p>The container element takes care of positioning the grid in relation to the page (typically center-justified) and adds outer margins.</p>
    <p>The grid element creates the actual columns (and gutters); eight columns for small viewports, sixteen for large.</p>

    {% highlight html %}
<div class="page-grid-container">
    <div class="page-grid">
        <!-- grid content goes here -->
    </div>
</div>
    {% endhighlight %}

    <p>Any content that is <em>off-grid</em>, a full bleed banner for example, should be placed outside of these two elements.</p>
    <p>Grid areas are definable with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-area">CSS Grid syntax</a>. The following CSS shows the grid layout of the Skin website itself.</p>

    <h3>Responsive Methodology</h3>
    <p>
        When working with responsive web pages, the mindset should always be mobile-first.
        This means that your default styles (outside of media queries) should be targeting
        phones - the smallest of screens. As such, there is no need to have a minimum
        threshold by wrapping mobile styles inside a media query.
    </p>
    <p>
        Though our minimum screen width support starts at <span class="highlight">320px</span>, in theory this means that
        default styles will support devices much narrower than that since we don't set a
        minimum. The <span class="highlight">320px</span> is, at best, an implied breakpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
        Subsequent media queries should increase in screen width and alter the UI
        styling additively avoiding style declaration duplications when possible.
    </p>

    <p>You can see that for small screens, our top-level landmark elements simply span the full width of the grid. For large screens, things are a little more interesting, and we specify exactly how many rows and columns each landmark should occupy on the grid.</p>

    <p>Here is the corresponding HTML.</p>

    {% highlight html %}
<body>
    <header>
        <!-- header content (off-grid) -->
    </header>
    <div class="page-grid-container">
        <div class="page-grid">
            <nav>
                <!-- nav content -->
            </nav>
            <main>
                <!-- main content -->
            </main>
            <footer>
                <!-- footer content -->
            </footer>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
    {% endhighlight %}

    <p>Obviously, this top-level page grid only gets us so far. How do we align the deeper nested elements and their content to our grid system?</p>
    <p>Watch this space for more information on how to create nested grids (with and without <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Subgrid">CSS Subgrid</a> support).</p>
