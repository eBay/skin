    <h2 id="techniques">Techniques</h2>
    <p>Skeletons can be used as placeholders for content (i.e. reserving physical space in the page) using either a pure CSS approach, or a DOM manipulation approach with JavaScript.</p>

    <h3 id="techniques-css">Technique 1: Pure CSS</h3>
    <p>This technique leverages the CSS <span class="highlight">:empty</span> pseudo-class, as documented in the article, <a href="https://dev.to/tigt/skeleton-screens-but-fast-48f1">"Skeleton screens, but fast"</a> by Taylor Hunt. This approach is highly performant, especially on devices with limited CPU resources.</p>
    <p>If an element is empty, then its <span class="highlight">:empty</span> selector matches, and the associated styles (i.e. the skeleton graphics) are applied. When the content is rendered, <span class="highlight">:empty</span> no longer matches, and the styles (our skeleton graphics) are removed. Marvellous!</p>
    <p>The HTML would look like this:</p>
    {% highlight html %}  
<div class="search-results-skeleton" role="img" aria-label="loading">
    <!-- this element will match :empty until content is inserted -->
</div>
    {% endhighlight %}

    <p>The CSS selector like so:</p>

    {% highlight css %}
.search-results-skeleton:empty {
    /* app developer must write CSS to create skeleton graphics */
}
    {% endhighlight %}

    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The <span class="highlight">:empty</span> pseudo-class considers elements with whitespace as not empty!</p>
    <p>The downside is that our <a href="../index.html#skeleton">skeleton classes</a> cannot be leveraged (in theory, LESS mixins could be provided) and <em>composite</em> skeletons (e.g. items tiles) may require some non-trivial use of CSS linear gradients for certain skeletons.</p>
    <p>A second potential downside is that these styles will be painted immediately by the browser, resulting in a quick flash of skeletons if the content or action is quick to resolve (say under 500ms or so).</p>

    <h3 id="techniques-javascript">Technique 2: JavaScript</h3>
    <p>With JavaScript, we gain more flexibility and control over when and how the skeleton placeholder is replaced with the actual content. We can either remove the the skeleton node from the DOM, as shown below.</p>

    {% highlight html %}
<!-- Before -->
<div class="skeleton" role="img" aria-label="loading" style="width: 200px;">
    <div class="skeleton__button"></div>
</div>

<!-- After -->
<div>
    <p>content</p>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Or we can simply hide the skeleton.</p>

{% highlight html %}
<!-- Before -->
<div class="skeleton" role="img" aria-label="loading" style="width: 200px;">
    <div class="skeleton__button"></div>
</div>

<!-- After -->
<div class="skeleton" role="img" aria-label="loading" style="width: 200px;" hidden>
    <div class="skeleton__button"></div>
</div>
<div>
    <p>content</p>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

    <h2 id="scenarios">Page Loading Scenarios</h2>
    <p>For the purposes of keeping examples simple, we use a basic blog template for conveying common loading techniques. In reality, blog pages are typically static (therefore cached and highly performant) and would not require skeletons. Please keep this in mind and think very carefully about whether your type of page and architecture actually requires the technical overhead of skeletons or not.</p>

    <p>We consider 4 main scenarios for how a full page may be constructed:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Buffered (default)</li>
        <li>Client-Side Rendered (SPA)</li>
        <li>In-Order Streaming (Progressive Rendering)</li>
        <li>Out of Order Streaming (requires framework)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Of course after the page is loaded and rendered is only part of the story! User interface components may also trigger <a href="#scenario-5">partial page updates</a>, in which case skeleton placeholders may also be utilized.</p>

    <h3 id="scenario-1">Scenario 1: Buffered Rendering</h3>
    <p>With buffered rendering (the default manner in which web pages are loaded) the client waits for the entire HTML to be sent by the server before rendering. Therefore, in this scenario, there is no opportunity to display skeleton placeholders, because the content arrives all at once (one caveat would be a SPA, which we cover in the next section).</p>

    <h4>The White Screen</h4>
    <p>This example simulates the delay (set to 3 seconds) and white screen while the client waits for the entire HTML payload from the server.</p>
    <p><a href="./buffered/example-1/">View Example</a></p>

    <hr />

    <h3 id="scenario-2">Scenario 2: Client Side Rendering (SPA)</h3>
    <p>A buffered page load can however be the starting point for a non-isomorphic client-side app, i.e. if the server sends a single script tag as the app entry point. The JavaScript app could then leverage skeletons as content placeholders.</p>
    <p>Fully client-side rendered JavaScript applications (i.e. SPAs) such as this are currently out of scope for this documentation. We may add updates in the future. In general though, many of the concepts of <a href="#scenario-4">out-of-order streaming</a> will apply.</p>

    <hr />

    <h3 id="scenario-3">Scenario 3: In-Order Streaming (Progressive Rendering)</h3>
    <p>In contrast to buffered rendering, progressive rendering does not have to wait for the entire HTML to arrive from the server. The client receives the HTML in chunks, allowing critical above-the-fold content to be displayed first, meaning less time staring at an empty white screen. For the vast majority of pages using progressive rendering, skeleton placeholders will be unneccessary, as the nature and speed in which content is streamed is a sufficient UX improvement over the "white screen" encountered with buffered rendering.</p>
    <p>The CSS <span class="highlight">:empty</span> technique is highly efficient for this scenario and basic skeleton orchestration. Any kind of complex skeleton orchestration would be better left to <a href="#scenario-4">out-of-order streaming</a>. Remember also, that our Skin skeleton classes cannot be leveraged with this technique; therefore the developer must construct skeletons with their own custom CSS.</p>
    <p>In all examples below we utilize client-side JavaScript to simulate how a server might stream the HTML in chunks to the client.</p>

    <h4>One Column with White Space</h4>
    <p>Our first progressive rendering example shows how the main article content might be streamed in after the main navigation and featured articles.</p>
    <p><a href="./in-order/example-1a/">View Example</a></p>
    <p>We have added a 3 second delay in order to simulate a service that is slow to fetch the main content. Remember, this is a highly contrived use case! No web site should be taking that long to retrieve static content and therefore would never require a skeleton!</p>

    <h4>One Column with Skeleton</h4>
    <p>Now let's add a skeleton placeholder for the main content. Using progressive rendering we stream an opening div tag to the client, and while the server works on getting the next chunk ready, the element will match the CSS :empty rule.</p>
    <p><a href="./in-order/example-1b/">View Example</a></p>
    <p>Okay, that was easy, our white space has been replaced with a skeleton while we wait for the next chunk to arrive. But what about when we have two columns?</p>

    <h4>Two Columns with White Space</h4>
    <p>To keep things simple lets assume the second column is also static content that will be quickly flushed from the server.</p>
    <p><a href="./in-order/example-2a/">View Example</a></p>
    <p>The goal of a skeleton is to replace empty white space with a placeholder graphic giving a rough approximation of the content and layout to come. Lets see if we can update our skeleton to show two columns instead of just one.</p>
    
    <h4>Two Columns with Skeleton</h4>
    <p>Our main column and side column are siblings elements, so we cannot start the side column element without flushing and closing the main column element that precedes it. This means we cannot have an :empty main column and an :empty side column simultaneously.</p>
    <p>With some clever CSS we can create a single background image graphic representing a two column layout on the :empty main column.</p>
    <p><a href="./in-order/example-2b/">View Example</a></p>
    <p>This might be satisfactory in some cases, but what if we want to show the main content without waiting for the side column to be flushed (the side content may be a slow service also)? What about responsive design? How will our two column skeleton respond at various breakpoints?</p>
    <p>At this point we start to see that choreographing more than one skeleton placeholder can become quite tricky. When we have more than one slow service, and a need for multiple skeleton placeholders, it is time to think about out-of-order streaming, which can eliminate these choreography concerns, but on the flipside has the potential to introduce the dreaded layout shift. Read on to find out more.</p>
    
    <hr />

    <h3 id="scenario-4">Scenario 4: Out-of-Order Streaming</h3>
    <p>Out-of-order streaming allows chunks of page content to arrive in any order, e.g. the server could send the chunk for the side column before the chunk for the main column. This technique does require some client-side JavaScript to re-assemble the DOM in the correct order as pieces arrive.</p>
    <p>Out-of-order streaming also has parallels with client-side rendered SPAs, as those apps might typically render content based on the order in which their fetch requests come in.</p>
    <p>In all examples below we utilize client-side JavaScript to simulate an out-of-order streaming experience.</p>

    <h4>Layout Shift</h4>
    <p>With our in-order streaming examples, the appereance of new content was always <em>appended</em>, therefore never caused existing content or layout to move. Let's see what happens when we stream in our main content, side column and footer out of order.</p>
    <p><a href="./out-of-order/example-0/">View Example</a></p>
    <p>As the content is loading, try clicking on the link in the footer. Now imagine if it were an "Add to Cart" or "Buy Now" button and how infuriating that would be. Imagine being a keyboard user, and the element you have focus on disappearing from view.</p>
    <p>So, while getting content to the user faster always sounds like a good idea in theory, this example showcases how it can cause some unintended consequences and a poor UX.</p>
    <p>The good news is that skeletons, under certain conditions, have the ability to mitigate or mask entirely the problems associated with content arriving out-of-order.</p>
  
    <h4>Reserving Space</h4>
    <p>Skeletons can prevent the layout shift associated with out-of-order streaming by reserving the physical space for that content.</p>
    <p><a href="./out-of-order/example-1/">View Example</a></p>
    <p>The physical dimensions of the reserved space must be known ahead of time. When skeletons reserve the right amount of space, they will prevent layout from shifting. When they reserve too much or too little, layout will shift.</p>
    <p>For some kinds of content, we can be sure of the physical dimensions ahead of time, images, videos, carousels, for example. For text however, we can only approximate in most cases, and therefore blocks of text make poor candidates for skeletons.</p>

    <h4>Skeleton-itis</h4>
    <p>We've had div-itis, class-itis, the latest thing is skeleton-itis! With in order streaming and the :empty technique, it was not possible to display more than one skeleton concurrently. With out-of-order streaming, this restriction is lifted.</p>
    <p>Let's see what happens when we create skeletons for the sections in the side content.</p>
    <p><a href="./out-of-order/example-2/">View Example</a></p>

    <h3 id="scenario-5">Scenario 5: Partial Page Updates</h3>
    <p>So far, our emphasis has been on the initial page load. Skeletons are also useful for partial page updates, i.e. when a user interface component triggers a request for additional data from the server. In this case, the skeleton is used to mask the layout shift that would otherwise occur.</p>
    
    <h4>Load More</h4>
    <p>This example highlights how unpredictable content can lead to layout shifts.</p>
