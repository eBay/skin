<div id="legacy-rounded-off">
    <h2>Legacy rounded off (Default design system only)</h2>
    <p>
        In order to use the old designs without rounded corners, include the module
        <span class="highlight">@ebay/skin/rounded-off</span> in order to revert the rounded corners.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to have this module loaded LAST so that it will properly override the rounded styles.
