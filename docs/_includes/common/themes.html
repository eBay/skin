    <p>CSS Custom Properties allow various aspects of the design system language to be dynamically "themed". Typically these aspects are colors, font, border-radius, spacing and grids.</p>

    <h3 id="themes-border-radius">Legacy Border-Radius</h3>
    <p>
        Our very first theme allows apps to opt out of the new rounded corner look and feel that was introduced in version 12. This legacy "theme" is intended only for teams wishing to upgrade their version of Skin, but who are not ready to take this particular change.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to use the theme, and switch off rounded corners, include the module
        <span class="highlight">@ebay/skin/rounded-off</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to have this module loaded LAST so that it will properly override the rounded styles.
