    <h2>Intelligent CSS Components</h2>
    <p>Skin is the official CSS framework of eBay. In addition to representing our brand, our framework follows several core principals.</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Accessible</dt>
        <dd>Skin leverages semantic HTML, SVG, ARIA roles, states and properties to apply our styles wherever possible, thus enforcing correct, accessible markup.</dd>

        <dt>Declarative</dt>
        <dd>Skin follows the <a href="http://getbem.com">BEM</a> methodology of "Block, Element and Modifier" to ensure our HTML class name and structure is human readable and understandable.</dd>

        <dt>Decoupled</dt>
        <dd>Skin is decoupled from the JavaScript layer, meaning that HTML and CSS should not need to be reimplemented when the JS frontend framework changes.</dd>

        <dt>Evergreen</dt>
        <dd>As the eBay design system evolves, so too does Skin, meaning apps only need to keep their Skin package updated to ensure the latest look and feel.</dd>
