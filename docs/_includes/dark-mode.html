<div id="dark-mode">
    <h2><span class="secondary-text">@ebay/skin/</span>dark-mode</h2>
    <p>This module enables compatibility with the operating system's dark color scheme/appearance - more commonly known as "dark mode".</p>
    <p>Every color property within Skin is exposed as a dynamic CSS Custom Property, via a system of tokens. When dark mode is activated this module simply <em>re-binds</em> those tokens using colors from our dark mode palette.</p>
