# Contributing

## System Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
* [Bundler](http://bundler.io)
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) ([install via Bundler](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/#step-2-install-jekyll-using-bundler))

## Want to Contribute?

Before writing any code, please submit a new issue to [GitHub](https://github.com/eBay/skin/issues). Or, if you want to work on an *existing* issue, please request to do so on the relevant ticket.

We **strongly** advise you to only begin working on issues that are assigned specifically to you and that are part of the upcoming milestone.

## How to Contribute

Here is a rough overview of steps required when contributing code to skin:

* Create a new branch in our Skin repo (preferred) or in your own fork
    * Please ensure you branch off from the correct milestone branch! See branching strategy section below.
* Skin adopts the [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) methodology (a popular naming convention for classes in HTML and CSS)
    * Please familiarize yourself with our style guide in the section below.
* After making changes to `.less` files, ensure that no new CSS lint warnings or errors are introduced
* Add or modify the associated html file(s) in the `docs/test` directory. More information in the tests section below.
* Update corresponding documentation. More information in [documentation](#documentation) section below.
* Check-in and sync code to the branch
    * Ensure new dist files (i.e. the compiled CSS files) are included in commit
    * <strike>Clone the "Skin2 - feature branch" CI Job and update the config with your branch details before running the job</strike>
    * <strike>The CI may create a new commit in your branch with new screenshots. Don't worry about squashing this commit.</strike>
* Send pull request
    * See Pull Requests section below

## Branching Strategy

Do not attempt to commit feature work directly to the `master` branch. Pushes to the `master` branch are restricted to admins and should only be used for important corrections to the documentation or website.

All other branches are "milestone" branches or "issue" branches.

Work for every "issue" must go in it's own branch. The branch name will match the issue number. For example, for issue number 202, a branch named `202` would be created.

Issue branches must be created from the relevant milestone branch. For example, if issue 202 will go out in the v2.6.7 milestone, then the 202 issue branch must be created from the 2.6.7 milestone branch.

Every milestone branch must be created from the `master` branch. For example, when beginning work on the 2.9.0 release, the `2.9.0` branch would be created from the `master` branch.

<strike>When work on an issue branch is complete and committed to the branch, the Jenkins CI job must be run on that branch. This may result in a new commit being added to the issue branch by the CI machine. After this point, a PR should be sent.</strike>

When all milestone issues are complete, and merged into the milestone branch, a Skin admin will merge the milestone branch into the `master` branch in preparation for the release.

A milestone branch will be deleted after it has been merged into `master`. There is no need to keep these milestone branches lying around, as we can go back to any point in time using tags. See the hotfix section below for more details.

## Pull Requests

Guidance for pull requests:

* Always double-check which branch you are attempting to merge into. The target branch should always be a milestone branch!
    * Only Skin admins are permitted to merge into `master`
* Non-atomic commits must be squashed
    * i.e. don't include any "work in progress" commits that are in a broken state in your PR
* Pull request must only contain changes related to the issue.
    * **Do not** be tempted to go fixing or refactoring unrelated issues - as it makes the code reviewers job a lot harder as well as increasing risk of regression
    * Think of yourself as a surgeon. Get in, fix the problem, and don't go tinkering with anything unrelated! If you do spot some other issue that bothers you, create an issue for it and it can be tackled separately.
* After the pull request has been merged, your issue branch should be immediately deleted (by yourself or reviewer)

## Style Guide

When contributing to Skin, please bear the following in mind:

* Ensure all markup adheres to our [accessibility patterns](https://ebay.gitbooks.io/mindpatterns/content/)
* Ensure all markup is valid HTML
* Leverage ARIA roles, states and properties for styling hooks wherever possible
* Use BEM syntax for modifiers (double-dash) and nested classes (double-underscore)
* Use inline SVG for icons and graphics (the icon-font is now frozen/deprecated)
* Harness CSS margin-collapse wherever possible
* Do not use the `<i>` tag for icons, use a `<span>` instead
* Do not use presentational classnames, e.g. `btn--green` should be `btn--secondary` for example
* Do not combine classes into a single classname, e.g. `btn-sec` should be `btn btn--sec`, this allows cascades without advanced attribute selectors or pre-processors
* Do not use ambiguous/global classnames, e.g. `large` should be `btn--large`
* Do not use class `disabled` to disable buttons or form elements, use the HTML `disabled` property instead
* Do not use class `active` on radio buttons or checkboxes, use `aria-selected` or `aria-checked` instead
* Do not wrap inputs with labels, use explicit labels instead (e.g. use the `for` and `id` attributes)
* Do not use `href="#"` or `href="javascript"` in examples, use `href="http://www.ebay.com"` or any other dummy url
* Every `<img>` tag must have an `alt` attribute, with **no** exceptions. The value can be an empty string for presentational images.
* Avoid naming conflicts with other grid systems (e.g. Bootstap Grids)
* Keep LESS pre-processor usage restricted to variables & mixins. 9 times out of 10 advanced features of pre-processors can be avoided by using CSS properly.
* Avoid too much nesting/indenting of LESS selectors as it can reduce human scanability of code and can also result in sub-optimal compiled CSS. The fewer rules required to check for a given element, the faster style resolution will be. This is the key to dramatically increasing performance.
[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Writing_efficient_CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Writing_efficient_CSS)
* Please do not commit commented code. All commented code should be deleted.

## Website Setup

First, be sure to Run `yarn install` to install all dependencies from NPM.

We use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to generate HTML from templates, and [Lasso](https://github.com/lasso-js/lasso) to bundle static files such as CSS & JS. The website can be run and hosted locally (see next section) during development.

We use [Bundler](http://bundler.io) to install, update and run Jekyll in our dev environment. This ensures the same Jekyll environment as GitHub Pages. GitHub have created a nice guide called [Setting up your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/) which we recommend you follow.

Once Jekyll is setup successfully, running a build should create the following file structure under `./_site`:

* `./_site/static/docs.css`
    * this is the Lasso output of `./docs/src/less`, as generated by Lasso
* `./_site/static/docs.js`
    * this is the Lasso output of `./docs/src/js`
* `./_site/test`
    * test pages, copied directly from `./docs/test`
* `./_site/_tmp/skin.css`
    * the full unminified skin css bundle copied directly from /dist
* `./_site/_tmp/grid-full.css`
    * the full unminified grid css bundle copied directly from /dist
* `./_site/index.html`
    * this is the Jekyll output of `./docs`

This is the exact same structure that will be generated by GitHub Pages.

## Local Server

Our GitHub Pages source is located in the `docs` folder. Test pages live under `docs/test`.

In order to start developing the website simply run: `npm start` which will build, bundle and run a BrowserSync server at http://localhost:3000. Test pages are available at http://localhost:3000/test.

## NPM Scripts

The following scripts are available:

* `npm start` - Runs a build and starts local BrowserSync server on port 3000
* `npm test` - Runs a build and lints CSS and LESS files
* `npm run build` - Runs a build only (no server)

## Test Pages & Continuous Integration (CI)

The Skin CI is currently out of service for an indefinite period of time.

<strike>
There is a suite of visual regression tests located under `/test`.

**THE CI MUST BE GREEN AT ALL TIMES!!! IF IT IS NOT GREEN THEN DON'T DEVELOP NEW MODULES OR PULL REQUESTS, FIX THE CI FIRST!!!**

If you build a new module, you must add the necessary test pages. You need to mark a part of the HTML to be your test. For this you just need to wrap with `<div class="test"></div>` in your `.html` test file. Ensure you only wrap the module to be tested!

The CI will pick up the existence of any new tests and generate screenshots and commit them to git automatically.

Workflow for interacting with the visual regression tests:

* Do not overwrite the screenshots that are on git (i.e.: don't push new screenshots)
* If you change a module on the `test/button/button-text.html` then just delete the respective screenshot (you can also delete the `screenshots folder` if making wholesale changes)
* After commit to GitHub, the CI will pick up the change and will then push new screenshots.
* Look at the CI to see if you broke the tests

**AGAIN: THE CI MUST BE GREEN AT ALL TIMES!!! IF IT IS NOT GREEN THEN DON'T DEVELOP NEW MODULES OR PULL REQUESTS, FIX THE CI FIRST!!!**
</strike>

## NPM Release

As of v3, the `@ebay/skin` module is published to the public NPM repository at https://registry.npmjs.org/.

Please ensure your NPM registry is set correctly and that you are on the package owners list, i.e. `npm owner ls @ebay/skin`.

Please follow the steps below to publish skin to NPM:

1. Build files must be stamped with the new version number. Increment the version number in `package.json` by hand (e.g. do **not** use `npm version` because this will create a git tag while the build files are still stamped with the *old* version number!)
1. Run `yarn build`. This will update the top comment section of build files with the new version number. This is needed for legal.
1. Revert the version number update you made to `package.json` in step 1.
1. Update any documentation references to reflect the new CDN url. [**Final release only**]
1. Commit the modified build files with message "Stamped files with vX.x.x" and push to origin.

Next, move on to pre-release or final release instructions below.

### Pre-Release

Pre-releases are made directly from a milestone branch. Patch releases do not need a pre-release (proceed directly to final release section below).

1. Run `npm version preminor` or `npm version premajor`. This command will update the version number in `package.json`, commit the change locally, and create a Git tag at the same time.
1. Push commit to origin.
1. Run `npm publish --tags beta` to publish the package to NPM.

### Final Release

Final releases are always made from the master branch. Minor and major version releases **must** be preceded by a pre-release (see above).

1. Merge the milestone branch into master branch in GitHub (via a pull request).
1. Switch to your local master branch and pull the changes from origin.
1. Run `npm version patch`, `npm version minor` or `npm version major`. This command will update the version number in `package.json`, commit the change locally and create a Git tag at the same time.
1. Push commit to origin.
1. Push the git tag to origin, e.g. `git push origin v3.1.0`.
1. Run `npm publish` to publish the package to NPM.

**TIP:** If you need to do an update or hotfix to an older minor release, please see the Hotfix Release section further below.

## GitHub Release

After the module has been successfully pushed to NPM you should go ahead and create a [Git release](https://github.com/eBay/skin/releases) using the new Git tag that was created.

The release notes should reference all issues inside the relevant milestone.

## Icon-Font Creation

The Skin Icon-Font is frozen. No new icons will be added to the font. Please use inline SVG instead.

<strike>
1. Open [icomoon app](https://icomoon.io/app/#/select) site to upload the new set of icons.
1. Click the `Hamburger icon` to the right of icomoon to remove the existing Set (this will remove all the existing icons).
1. Import the existing icon set (icon-font.json) from your local folder `skin/src/fonts/icon-font.json` using `Import Icons` button .
1. Click the `Hamburger icon` and select `Import to Set`.  Now upload the new icons (icon name should not contain icon. eg:  collections.svg).
1. New icons will come on the first row. Now select the new icon and move to the end using `Select` and `Move` tool.
1. Click the `Generate Font` (docked at the bottom) to generate the new icons and Mouse over on the generated font and click Get Code. Now use the HTML `<span class=”icon-collections”></span>` and CSS `.icon-collections:before {content : “\e900”;}`.
1. Download the new font files by clicking `Download` button docked at the bottom.
1. Remove the old font files and copy paste the new `eot, svg, ttf, woff and json files` to your branch with proper naming. (eg : icon-fonts.json, vq-icon-font.eot, vq-icon-font.svg, vq-icon-font.ttf and vq-icon-font.woff).
1. Upload new font files using CDN release process as described above
1. Update the latest @font-url path in the `core/variables.less` file.
</strike>

## Hotfix Release

If the `master` branch is currently at `v2.6.x`, but we need to go back and apply a critical bug fix to `v2.4.x`, what do we do?

Git tags to the rescue! Git tags allow us to go back to a moment in time on our `master` branch and rewrite our commit history by *injecting* any number of commits right after the tagged commit.

**Do not try and push an entire feature in a hot fix!! A hotfix is allowed for small one-liner type fixes only.**

This is not for the faint-hearted, so please read carefully:

1. Backup the current `master` branch on GitHub. You will need this backup if things go "pear shaped".
1. Go to tags page: https://github.com/eBay/skin/tags
1. Select the tag you'd like to go back in time to, e.g. https://github.com/eBay/skin/tree/v2.4.3
1. Select the tag dropdown and create a new branch, e.g hotfix-2.4.4
1. Git pull & checkout the new branch in your local machine, e.g. `git checkout hotfix-2.4.4`
1. For your sanity, run `git log` to ensure branch only has commit history up to the selected tag
1. Make your changes in the branch as usual and checkin and push your branch
1. Do your your npm & cdn release from this hotfix branch but **do not** push your new git tag yet!
1. Checkout the `master` branch
1. Run `git rebase hotfix-2.4.4`. Git will now rebase the `master` branch on top of the commits you made in the hotfix. You may need to address some merge conflicts.
1. If all goes well, after all merge conflicts are addressed, you need to force push the `master` branch `git push -f`
1. Run `git push origin v2.4.4` to push your new git tag
1. Your hotfix release will now show up in the GitHub release history
