    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Skin is the official CSS framework of eBay. Skin represents the eBay brand and adheres to the following core principals:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Accessible</dt>
        <dd>Skin leverages semantic HTML, SVG & ARIA to apply our styles wherever possible; thus enforcing correct, accessible markup.</dd>
        <dt>Declarative</dt>
        <dd>Skin follows the <a href="https://getbem.com">BEM</a> methodology of "Block, Element and Modifier" to ensure our HTML class name and structure is human readable and understandable.</dd>
        <dt>Decoupled</dt>
        <dd>Skin is decoupled from the JavaScript layer, meaning the HTML and CSS is agnostic of the frontend framework.</dd>
        <dt>Evergreen</dt>
        <dd>As the eBay design system evolves, so too does Skin, meaning apps only need to keep their Skin package updated to ensure the latest look and feel.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Skin is a pure CSS framework and is bundled with zero JavaScript. This website uses <a href="https://github.com/makeup/makeup-js">makeup-js</a> to add interactivity to examples where needed.</p>
